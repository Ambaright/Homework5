Use table() to accomplish this.\n– Interpret a number from each resulting table (that is, pick out a value produced and explain what that value means.)\n\nWe first start with the one-way contingency table for address, to determine the counts for students who live in an Urban or Rural area. From the table below we see that 253 students out of the two Portuguese schools have an Urban home address.\n\ntable(school_data$address)\n\n\nUrban Rural \n  253    67 \n\n\nNow we can look at a two-way contingency table for address and higher, to determine the counts for students interested in higher education across the two home address types Urban and Rural. From the table below we see that 64 out of the 67 Rural students want to take higher education.\n\ntable(school_data$address, school_data$higher)\n\n       \n         no yes\n  Urban   4 249\n  Rural   3  64\n\n\nWe can also take a look at a three-way contingency table for address, higher, and Pstatus. From the table below we see that of the students whose parents live together, 4 of the students living in an Urban home address do not have intentions of going for higher education.\n\ntable(school_data$address, school_data$higher, school_data$Pstatus)\n\n, ,  = Together\n\n       \n         no yes\n  Urban   4 223\n  Rural   2  60\n\n, ,  = Apart\n\n       \n         no yes\n  Urban   0  26\n  Rural   1   4\n\n\n\nCreate a conditional two-way table using table(). That is, condition on one variable’s setting and create a two-way table. Do this using two different methods:\n– Once, by subsetting the data (say with filter()) and then creating the two-way table\n\nWe can subset the data to only have students whose parents are living together.\n\ntogether_data &lt;- school_data |&gt;\n  filter(Pstatus == \"Together\")\ntable(together_data$address, together_data$higher)\n\n       \n         no yes\n  Urban   4 223\n  Rural   2  60\n\n\n– Once, by creating a three-way table and subsetting it\nWe can similarly create this same conditional two-way table using the three-way table and subsetting it.\n\nthree_way_address_higher_Pstatus &lt;- table(school_data$address, school_data$higher, school_data$Pstatus)\nthree_way_address_higher_Pstatus[,,1]\n\n       \n         no yes\n  Urban   4 223\n  Rural   2  60\n\n\n\nCreate a two-way contingency table using group_by() and summarize() from dplyr. Then use pivot_wider() to make the result look more like the output from table().\n\n\nschool_data |&gt;\n  group_by(address, higher) |&gt;\n  summarize(count = n()) |&gt;\n  pivot_wider(names_from = higher, values_from = count)\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'address'. You can override using the\n`.groups` argument.\n\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 3\n# Groups:   address [2]\n  address    no   yes\n  &lt;fct&gt;   &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n1 Urban       4   249\n2 Rural       3    64\n\n\n\nCreate a stacked bar graph and a side-by-side bar graph. Give relevant x and y labels, and a title for the plots.\n\nFor our stacked bar graph, we can look at address and higher. From the stacked bar graph below, we notice that for both Urban and Rural students, there is a small count of students who do not have higher education goals. This is consistent with our contingency table findings.\n\ng &lt;- ggplot(data = school_data, aes(x = address, fill = higher))\ng + geom_bar() +\n  labs(x = \"Home Address\", y = \"Count of Students\", \n       title = \"Stacked Bar Graph of Students Home Address and Higher Education Goals\") +\n  scale_fill_discrete(\"Higher Education Goals\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can now do a side-by-side bar plot for Pstatus and activities. From the side-by-side bar plot below, we again see that for both Urban and Rural students, a low count of students are not involved in activities outside of school. Although, when comparing the Urban and Rural group, the Urban group may have more students who are not involved in activities compared to the rural group.\n\ng &lt;- ggplot(data = school_data, aes(x = Pstatus, fill = activities))\ng + geom_bar(position = \"dodge\") +\n  labs(x = \"Parental Living Status\", y = \"Count of Students\",\n       title = \"Side-by-side Bar Graph of Parental Living Status and Student Involved in Activities\") +\n  scale_fill_discrete(\"Student Involved in Activities\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumeric Variables (across groups)\nThe numeric variables are age, absences, and the three test grades variables (G1, G2, and G3) from each data set (math and Portuguese).\n\nFind measures of center and spread for three of these variables (including at least one G3 variable)\n\nHere the three numeric variables of interest are age, math G3 score, and Portuguese G3 score. From these summaries we see that on average, there is a higher Portuguese G3 score, or Final Grade, compared to the Math G3 score. Specifically there is on average a 1.84 point difference in the Final Grade between these two classes, with the Portuguese Final Grade having a smaller standard deviation compared to the Math Final Grade standard deviation.\n\nschool_data |&gt;\n  summarize(mean_age = mean(age), sd_age = sd(age), mean_mat_G3 = mean(G3.x),\n            sd_mat_G3 = sd(G3.x), mean_por_G3 = mean(G3.y), sd_por_G3 = sd(G3.y))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 6\n  mean_age sd_age mean_mat_G3 sd_mat_G3 mean_por_G3 sd_por_G3\n     &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     16.5   1.14        11.0      4.30        12.9      2.89\n\n\n– Repeat while subsetting the data in a meaningful way.\nHere we can subset to only include students who want to take higher education. We note that for students who want to take higher education, there is a similar trend in the difference in means between the Portuguese Final Grade and the Math Final Grade, with the Portuguese Final Grade having a slightly larger mean and smaller standard deviation compared to the Math Final Grade.\n\nschool_data |&gt;\n  filter(higher == \"yes\") |&gt;\n  summarize(mean_age = mean(age), sd_age = sd(age), mean_mat_G3 = mean(G3.x),\n            sd_mat_G3 = sd(G3.x), mean_por_G3 = mean(G3.y), sd_por_G3 = sd(G3.y))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 6\n  mean_age sd_age mean_mat_G3 sd_mat_G3 mean_por_G3 sd_por_G3\n     &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     16.5   1.10        11.1      4.25        13.0      2.85\n\n\n\nFind measures of center and spread across a single grouping variable for three of these variables (including a G3 variable as one of them)\n\nHere we will use the same three numeric variables (age, math G3 score and Portugues G3 score) group according to address.

For this summarization, we see something interesting when we include a grouping of Parental Status. When comparing across Rural students, we see that those whose parents are living together have a lower math and portuguese final grade compared to Rural students whose parents live apart. However, for Urban students, we see a similar mean Final Grade for the Math and Portuguese classes across student’s whose parents live together and who live apart.\n\nschool_data |&gt;\n  group_by(address, Pstatus) |&gt;\n  summarize(mean_age = mean(age), sd_age = sd(age), mean_mat_G3 = mean(G3.x),\n            sd_mat_G3 = sd(G3.x), mean_por_G3 = mean(G3.y), sd_por_G3 = sd(G3.y))\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'address'.

Add appropriate labels and titles.\n\nHere we can look at the age and G3.y (Portuguese) across the address variable. That is we will create six different graphs.\nFirst we have a histogram for student age across home address. From this graph we see that the largest age group of students in urban areas is 16, whereas in rural areas it is 17. We also see that there is a possible outlier with one Urban student being 22.\n\n#Histogram for age and address\nhist &lt;- ggplot(data = school_data, aes(x = age, fill = address))\nhist + geom_bar(position = \"dodge\") +\n  labs(x = \"Age of Students\", y = \"Count of Students\", \n       title = \"Histogram of Age of Students Across Home Address\") +\n  scale_fill_discrete(\"Home Address\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext we have a kernel density plot for student age across home address. With the kernel density plot below, we again see that there is a higher frequency of students aged 17 and 18 among those living in Rural areas. Whereas, for students living in urban areas, we see multiple peaks in the plot.\n\n#Kernel Density Plot for Age and Address\nkernel &lt;- ggplot(data = school_data, aes(x = age))\nkernel + geom_density(alpha = 0.5, aes(fill = address)) +\n  labs(x = \"Age of Students\", y = \"Frequency of Students\",\n       title = \"Kernel Density Plot for Age of Students Across Home Address\") +\n  scale_fill_discrete(\"Home Address\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we have a box plot for age of students across address. In the box plot below we see that the Rural students have a larger variation of ages, and that the student who lives in an Urban area and is aged 22 is most likely an outlier.\n\n#Box Plot for Age and Address\nbox &lt;- ggplot(data = school_data, aes(x = address, y = age, fill = address))\nbox + geom_boxplot() +\n  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, alpha = 0.3) +\n  labs(x = \"Home Address\", y = \"Age of Students\", \n       title = \"Box Plot for Age of Students Across Home Address\") +\n  scale_fill_discrete(\"Home Address\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can now examine the same plots but for the Portuguese final grade (G3.y) across home address. In the histogram below we see that most urban students scored in the 10/20 to 15/20 range for Portuguese final grade. We see a similar finding for rural students, but it’s important to note that more rural students received a final grade of 0/20 compared to the urban students.\n\n#Histogram for Portuguese final grade and address\nhist &lt;- ggplot(data = school_data, aes(x = G3.y, fill = address))\nhist + geom_bar(position = \"dodge\") +\n  labs(x = \"Portugues Final Grade\", y = \"Count of Final Grade Scores\", \n       title = \"Histogram of Portuguese Final Grade Across Home Address\") +\n  scale_fill_discrete(\"Home Address\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the kernel density plot below, we see a similar trend as in the histogram. Specifically, we see that the urban students scored higher for the Portuguese Final Grade compared to the rural students.\n\n#Kernel Density Plot for Portugues Final Grade and Address\nkernel &lt;- ggplot(data = school_data, aes(x = G3.y))\nkernel + geom_density(alpha = 0.5, aes(fill = address)) +\n  labs(x = \"Portuguese Final Grade\", y = \"Frequency of Final Grade\",\n       title = \"Kernel Density Plot for Portugues Final Grade Across Home Address\") +\n  scale_fill_discrete(\"Home Address\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, the box plot below confirms that the distribution of urban students scored higher on the Portuguese final grade compared to the rural students, due to the IQR for urban students falling in a higher grade range compared to the rural students.\n\n#Box Plot for Portugues Final Grade and Address\nbox &lt;- ggplot(data = school_data, aes(x = address, y = G3.y, fill = address))\nbox + geom_boxplot() +\n  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, alpha = 0.3) +\n  labs(x = \"Home Address\", y = \"Portuguese Final Grade\", \n       title = \"Box Plot for Portuguese Final Grade Across Home Address\") +\n  scale_fill_discrete(\"Home Address\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate two scatterplots relating a G3 variable to other numeric variables (put G3 on the y-axis). You should jitter the points if they sit on top of each other. Color the points by a categorical variable in each. Add appropriate labels and titles.\n\nHere we will relate the Portuguese Final Grade (G3.y) to the Portuguese First Period Grade (G1.y) across the Student’s Home Address. We see that for both Home Addresses, students typically improved in their Portuguese class when comparing the first period grade and the final grade. However, there are some outliers among the urban and rural students, as some rural students scored a zero on the final grade and some urban students scored a zero for the first period grade.\n\n#Scatterplot of Portuguese First Period Grade and Final Grade\nscatter &lt;- ggplot(school_data, aes(x = G1.y, y = G3.y, color = address))\nscatter + geom_point() +\n  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.3) +\n  labs(x = \"Portuguese First Period Grade\", y = \"Portuguese Final Grade\",\n       title = \"Scatterplot of Student's Portuguese First Period Grade vs. Final Grade\", color = \"Home Address\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can now relate absences in the Portuguese class (absences.y) with the Portuguese Final Grade (G3.y) across the Student’s Home Address. From the scatterplot below we notice that for the most part, less absences in the Portuguese class correlates to a higher final grade. However, there are a few urban students who are outliers and appear to be those students who can miss class and still do really well in the class.\n\n#Scatterplot of Portuguese Class Absences and Portuguese Final Grade\nscatter &lt;- ggplot(school_data, aes(x = absences.y, y = G3.y, color = address))\nscatter + geom_point() +\n  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.3) +\n  labs(x = \"Portuguese Class Absences\", y = \"Portuguese Final Grade\",\n       title = \"Scatterplot of Portuguese Class Absences vs. Portuguese Final Grade\", color = \"Home Address\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepeat the scatter plot step but use faceting to obtain graphs at each setting of another categorical variable.\n\nHere we will facet by the Parental Status Pstatus variable. We first look at the relationship between Portuguese First Period Grade vs Final Grade. From the scatterplot below we notice that there isn’t too much of a difference in the trend between the Portuguese first period grade and the final grade across students whose parents live together versus those whose parents live apart. Which suggests that maybe parental status does not impact the improvement between the first period grades and final grades for the portuguese class.\n\n#Scatterplot of Portuguese First Period Grade and Final Grade with Facet of Pstatus\nscatter &lt;- ggplot(school_data, aes(x = G1.y, y = G3.y, color = address))\nscatter + geom_point() +\n  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.3) +\n  labs(x = \"Portuguese First Period Grade\", y = \"Portuguese Final Grade\",\n       title = \"Scatterplot of Student's Portuguese First Period Grade vs. Final Grade\", subtitle = \"Across Parental Status\", color = \"Home Address\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ Pstatus)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we can do a similar thing with the Portuguese Class Absences and Portuguese Final Grade. We again can see a similar trend in the class absences and final grade for the portuguese class when comparing student’s parental status. For both parental status’ we see those outlier urban students who can miss more classes and still perform relatively well on the final grade. However, it is interesting to note that for rural students whose parents live together, there are a few outliers who have zero absences and still scored a 0/20, which suggests that these students may have not taken the portuguese class.\n\n#Scatterplot of Portuguese Class Absences and Portuguese Final Grade across Parental Status\nscatter &lt;- ggplot(school_data, aes(x = absences.y, y = G3.y, color = address))\nscatter + geom_point() +\n  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.3) +\n  labs(x = \"Portuguese Class Absences\", y = \"Portuguese Final Grade\",\n       title = \"Scatterplot of Portuguese Class Absences vs. Portuguese Final Grade\", color = \"Home Address\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ Pstatus)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepeat the scatter plot step but use faceting to obtain graphs at each combination of two categorical variables.\n\nIn addition to faceting by Parental Status (Pstatus), we can also recreate our scatterplots by faceting by Higher Education Goals (higher).\nFirst we add the Higher Education Goals facet to our scatterplot of Portuguese First Period Grade vs. Final Grade. We note that there is a small number of students across parental status who did not have higher education goals. However, this graph does communicate to us that for those students who do not have higher education goals, across both parental status’ we see a similar mid-level relationship between the first period grade and final grade for the portuguese class. We also note that for those who do have higher education goals, we saw a positive trend across both parental status’ of improvement between the first period grade and final grade for the portuguese class.\n\n#Scatterplot of Portuguese First Period Grade and Final Grade with Faceting of Pstatus and Higher\nscatter &lt;- ggplot(school_data, aes(x = G1.y, y = G3.y, color = address))\nscatter + geom_point() +\n  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.3) +\n  labs(x = \"Portuguese First Period Grade\", y = \"Portuguese Final Grade\",\n       title = \"Scatterplot of Student's Portuguese First Period Grade vs. Final Grade\", subtitle = \"Across Higher Education Goals and Parental Status\", color = \"Home Address\") +\n  facet_wrap(higher ~ Pstatus)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly we can do it with our other scatterplot for Portuguese class absenses and final grades, and observe similar trends as we noted before in prior graphs. We see that across higher education goals and parental status’, students who missed less class typically scored a little better on the exam. But again, we see there are outlier urban students, mainly among those who have higher education goals, where students missed a ton of classes and still received a relatively decent final grade in the portuguese class.\n\n#Scatterplot of Portuguese Class Absences and Portuguese Final Grade across Higher Education Goals and Parental Status\nscatter &lt;- ggplot(school_data, aes(x = absences.y, y = G3.y, color = address))\nscatter + geom_point() +\n  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.3) +\n  labs(x = \"Portuguese Class Absences\", y = \"Portuguese Final Grade\",\n       title = \"Scatterplot of Portuguese Class Absences vs. Portuguese Final Grade\", color = \"Home Address\") +\n  facet_wrap(higher ~ Pstatus)"
